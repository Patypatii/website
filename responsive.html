                <h2>THE IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELIGENCE</h2>
                <p>By following these steps, I created a compelling and engaging animation that effectively communicates 
                    the story of Phil and his mission to address racial disparities in healthcare through AI technology.
                    Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide on how I created the animation using Blender software:
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Scripting: I Started by writing the animation idea on paper. This helped to plan the visual 
                        sequence of the animation and decide on camera angles, character placement, and key actions.
                        2. Modeling: I used Blender's modeling tools to create 3D models of characters, props, and 
                        environments based on the storyboard. I ensured they matched the vision in the script.
                        3. Texturing: I applied textures to 3D models to add color, surface detail, and realism. 
                        I created my textures and also used pre-made textures from Blender's built-in library and 
                        external sources.
